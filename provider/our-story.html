          Our simple high school fling has grown into more that I could have ever imagined. Shared memories evolved from simple school time bus rides together to life changing decisions about adopting two cats.

          Our time together has gotten better every year and I expect the future to be no different.

          Our first date consisted of Super Nintendo and air hockey. Our first kiss consisted of me hitting Kyle with a coat hanger. Our first picture together consists of Kyle in braces and me with a whole lot of crimped hair. Who would have thought that was the making of something so perfect?

          Now looking back I realize how truly blessed I am to have found the love of my life at age 16 and to share a lifetime of memories before we even start our married life together. Get ready to celebrate with us – we’re ready to finally make this official and party the night away!
